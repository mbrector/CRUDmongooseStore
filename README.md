# Welcome to WALMATT

This is my second project at my Per Scholas Internship. It is a CRUD application storefront.

You can see an index of all products:

![Index](index.jpg)

From there you can click on the image of something you may want to know more about or "purchase":

![Show](show.jpg)

From the Show page you can Edit, go back to the Index, Delete, or "Buy" this product (which will decrease inventory by one)

In your terminal make sure you are in the cloned folder  
Also in your terminal install needed packages with `npm install`  
You can start with a few items that I have provided with `node seeds.js`  
Finally, in your terminal run `nodemon`
